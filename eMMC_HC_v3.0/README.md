This is the AXI SD-eMMC Host Controller IP Core repository
==========================================================
The AXI SD-eMMC Host Controller (HC) IP Core is SD/eMMC card communication controller designed to be
used in a System-on-Chip. IP core provides interface for any CPU with AXI bus. The communication between the MMC/SD card controller and MMC/SD card is performed according to the SD/eMMC protocol.

## Introduction
This IP core based on the "Wishbone SD Card Controller IP Core" project from https://github.com/mczerski/SD-card-controller
The IP core has been rewritten from Wishbone to the AXI interface and adapted to "SD Specification Part A2 Version 3.00" and "JEDEC Standard No. 84-B51". Major changes:

- Control register address map has been changed for almost all registers,
- Data bytes alignment order has been changed,
- Interrupt generation logic has been added for data and command layer,
- FIFO replaced to Xilinx standard FIFO primitive,
- ODDR, IDDR primitives are added,
- SDMA module is created, then wrapped into the ADMA module,
- Extended amount of control registers,

## Features
The SD/eMMC HC provides the following features:
- 4-bit SD card or/and  8-bit eMMC card mode (does not support SPI mode)
- Hardware interrupt for data and command transactions
- 32-bit AXI Interface
- 50 MGh clock, Single Data Rate (SDR) or/and Double Data Rate (DDR)
- ADMA2 support
- AutoCMD23 feature support
- Compatible with Linux distributed Arasan SDHCI driver

## Howto
To make driver support 8-bit need to add a line "mmc->caps |= MMC_CAP_8_BIT_DATA;" to the "drivers/mmc/host/sdhci.c#L3107"

## The hardware on which HC were run
- Boards:
	- Parallella
	- ZedBoard
- Cards:
	- Hardkernel v0.3
